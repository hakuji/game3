## About ##
Game 3 is a simple hack and slash game.
It is coded in python and uses pyglet for the graphical parts.

## Dependencies ##
Before testing you need to install its dependencies. OS related dependencies
are the same as the ones for pyglet[1].

The python dependencies should be installed with pip:

    $ pip install -r dependencies.txt

Checkout virtualenvwrapper[2] to see how to install the dependencies without root
privileges.
