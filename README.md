## About ##
Game 3 is a rouge inspired game, that hase a gameplay similar to pre-nintendo 64
zelda. It is coded in python and uses pyglet for the graphical parts.

## Dependencies ##
To test it you need pyglet installed.

On debian-like systems use

    # apt-get install python-pyglet

Gentoo and Arch have a pretty up-to-date version of the pyglet. See if it works
for you :-)

Fedora has 1.1.2 packaged, so the official repository version might not work.

If your system is not listed or does not package a version of pyglet that works
out of the box check this site: http://www.pyglet.org/download.html

## Running ##

    $ git clone https://github.com/hakuji/game3.git
    $ cd game3/
    $ python src/main.py
