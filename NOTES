Initially I thought it was a pretty good idea to make random dungeons.
It would take just a bunch of descriptions about obligatory rooms, enemies and
objects to create a whole level, that would speed up the creation of the game.
However generating a random dungeon was troublesome. The placement of rooms and
pathways proved to be too dificult and I was too lazy. That design also
contradicted my initial expectations creating of a game with several puzzles and
other mental challenges, with a random dungeon how could I be sure that between
this room and that room there is a maze of hallways infested with dangerous
creatures connected by traps and other diversions.

So I thought it was best to take a more experimented path and create the levels
by hand. Doing so with only text can be boring, so there is a immediate need to
create a GUI, a level creator. Thats what I hope to do now.
